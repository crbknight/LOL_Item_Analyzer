# League of Legends Gold Efficiency Spreadsheet

## About

This is a small tool built in python using the Riot Games API to pull item data. The goal is to analyze what is known as [Gold Efficiency](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_efficiency_(League_of_Legends)).

The tool will dynamically calculate gold efficiencies for all of the current items in the game (in the classic gamemode Summoner's Rift) and generate a CSV that can easily be imported to Excel or Google Sheets.

## Dependencies

To use this tool you will need to install Python, requests, and regex. Install Python either through the Microsoft Store or through the [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

Requests and Regex can be installed via pip:
`pip install requests`
`pip install regex`
will install both.

After installation you can run `main.py` to generate a CSV file of the current League of Legends patch
## Importing to Google Sheets
After generating a CSV file using `main.py` you can import it to Google Sheets via:

`File > Import > Upload`, It is recommended to choose the option `Insert new sheet(s)` but it is not required.

## format.js
Attached is a script called `format.js` which can be used to auto format a Google Sheet. After importing the CSV a blank Google Sheet (or using an existing one) navigate to:

`Extensions > Apps Script`. Then simply copy and paste the code and run.

## Current Google Sheets
If you don't want to create a Google Sheet you may use [this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17HQ759AxdWPLuvLUE7s0Bj-dD7z98aVPNpgDF0aFgRo/edit?usp=sharing) to quickly view the calculations.

The sheet is up to date as of patch **14.19.1**. 

This read.me may or may not be accurate or the Google Sheet may or may not be up to date. It is recommended to create and upkeep your own.
